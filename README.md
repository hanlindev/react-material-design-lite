# react-material-design-lite
React component wrappers around Google's Material Design Lite library
This is a fork of [iceddev's react-material-design-lite](https://github.com/iceddev/react-material-design-lite).

Following is a list of changes:
1. Remove reference to material design lite's assets, so that I can load my custom stylesheet.
2. Modify a few components to make them easier to use, at least for me.

Note:
I forked this repo because I'm quickly prototyping my project and I need to modify this project quite often to make it work for me. Robustness is not a concern so there is no plan to add unit test. Please contribute or create your own fork if you find this useful and would like to write tests for it. Thanks!
